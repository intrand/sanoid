# Setting cron_interval influences what possible schedules you can use.
# cron must run at least as often as the quickest (shortest interval) schedule,
# you have set or you'll be missing snapshots.
cron_interval: hourly # any cron special time (@daily, @hourly, etc, but without the @ in front)

# A simple AND practical example configuration:
# pools:
#   - name: my_data
#     schedule:
#       hourly: 24
#       daily: 3
#       monthly: 3
#     datasets:
#       - name: Code
#       - name: Documents
#       - name: Music
#       - name: Movies
#       - name: Shows

# The following example shows two zfs pools.
# One is named "my_data" and has important stuff in it.
# The other is named "Media" and has backups of purchased media
# that can be re-made in case of total disk failure.
# In practice, your config should look much more simple (above) than this overly-complicated example (below).
# This just shows off what's possible with this ansible role
pools:
  - name: my_data
    auto:
      snap: "yes" # take snapshots (this is the default)
      prune: "yes" # remove old snapshots (this is the default)

    schedule: # at what frequency do you want to take/prune snapshots?
      frequently: 0 # this means "minutely" - every minute! no, thanks!
      hourly: 24 # if the change was more than 24 hours ago...
      daily: 3 # jump back up to 3 days ago. if it was before that...
      monthly: 3 # jump back up to 3 months ago. if it was before that, you're hosed. 
      yearly: 0 # no yearly backups

    datasets:
      - name: Code # 'recursive = yes' is implied
      - name: Documents

  - name: Media
    # auto.snap implied "yes"
    # auto.prune implied "yes"

    schedule:
      daily: 3 # ONLY keep daily snapshots for datasets in this pool; all other times default to 0 snapshots

    datasets:
      - name: Music
        recursive: "no"
        overrides: # but also do hourly for only this specific dataset
          - key: hourly
            value: 1
      - name: Movies
      - name: Shows
